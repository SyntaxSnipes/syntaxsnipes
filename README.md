### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Mohammed Aayan Pathan. I am 15 years old. I am a new Software Developer, specializing in Front-End Web-Developing, though I aspire to be a Full-Stack. I am a second year GCSE student at GEMS Founders School Al Barsha, in Dubai. I am into making websites and software that I personally think are super cool and neat, and I also like to learn and use new languages and technologies to help me along the way! In my free time, I like to play video games, and do Maths or Physics.
You can find my online curriculum vitae/portofolio at [aayanpathan.com](https://aayanpathan.com).
